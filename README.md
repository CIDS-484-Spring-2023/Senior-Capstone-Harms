App title: GET ABS (Accountability Buddy System

________________________________________________________________________________________

Description: This project will be creating an app that allows an individual to connect with friends when working out. Many of us struggle with going to the gym by ourselves, but when we are going with friends or meeting up with a workout partner we are more inclined to go because we know that our partner or friend will hold us accountable. This is precisely what this app is going to be dedicated to. The app is your way to have your accountability buddy with you wherever you go. You can set goals and share them with your friends. Whenever you start a workout your friends will be notified and vice versa. The point of this app is to encourage you to go the gym even if you don't have someone to go with and at the same time that person will be able to hold you accountable especially if you haven't gone in a while. It will work similarly to other social media apps with messaging and following friends and groups. The difference here is that this is strictly for working out, creating workouts that you can share with friends, and your posts are more like a timecard that you punch in at work. This app is meant tto connect you and your accountability buddy no matter how far apart you are.

I will be using Axure for my app prototype and just to get a general layout. I will be attempting to learn and implement my app through React Native, otherwise, I will use HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The database for the app will store information such as: username, password, name, email, age, friends, workouts, goals, and dates. I will also be using an agile development method to create my app and will use user stories to formulate what aspects of the app I need/want to be included.
