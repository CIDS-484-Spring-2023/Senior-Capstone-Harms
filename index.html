         <h1> GET ABS </h1>
        
         <p>This app would allow users to connect with one another when working out and this can allow each other to one another accountable.
         </p>
        <h2>Goals</h2>
         <p>The goal of the app is to allow friends to conect when working out and to have an accountability buddy help them stay on thrack with their workout goals. The app will allow for messgaing between friends, sending/sharing workouts to one another, create goals, post when you are currenlty working out, and allow you to be connected with your buddy at all times. We all struggle with motivation at one time or another, so its important to have someone by your side to push you back on track and to help you achieve your goals. Accountabiity buddy systems have proven to help individuals reach their goals, but it can difficult if shedules don't line up or if soemone moves away. You still want that connection and that perosn you trust to be there for you, so that's why this app needs to be created. This app will connect one another so that way when you are feeling stuck rsather than feeling helpless that your buddy isn't there to help you, they can send you a message or a workout to do and they can see your progress and cheer you on along the way.

            <ul>
               <li>Create a database that stores personal information inorder to create an account such as: phone, email, passwords, username, name, age, friends, workouts, goals</li>
               <li>Develop an app that sends notification when someone messages you, someone starts a workout, someone friends you, or when a freidn hasn't workouted out in a while.</li>
               <li>App will prompt you to create goals that will be put on your profile (you have the option to make it public or private)</li>
               <li>Customers will be able to create a profile and add their own workouts or pull workouts from the given database</li>
               <li>The app will post who is working out and who finished a workout</li>
               <li>Friends can message you on the app and send workouts</li>
            </ul>
         </p>
        
      <h2> Customers </h2>
        
      <p> The customers of this app would be any person who works out and wants to help out their friends or even just keep track of their own accomplishments. This could also be for anyone just starting out and has friends that are willing to cheer them on along the way ontheir journey to being healthy. This app could also be used by teams or workout groups who send out workout plans and wants to make sure everyone did them on their own time rather than trying to schedule a time for everyone to meet and do it together. Fitness trainers could alos use this app as a way to help clients who might be on vacation, but still wnat to get some exercise in or even strecthing. Needless to say anyone could use this app if they wanted to get healthy, doesn't matter if they beginners or experienced gym bros.</p>
        
      <h2>Technology</h2>
        
      <p>The technologies could be used to create this app would be SQL/mySQL, React Native for app development or GUI depending (see below), Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
        
      <h2>Scope</h2>
        
      <p>I believe that I will be able to complete the general layout of this app meaning the mesaging system, databse, and creating a profile. The extras such as creating a goal, workout, or group is something that I am unsure if I will be able to complete in time. However, I am confident that I will be able to create a general messaging app about that would allow a person to check in when they are working out and a notification would be sent when this occurs. Along with messagign friending and the graphic sthat come along with an app. </p>
